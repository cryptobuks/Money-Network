# Zeronet-Money-Network
Demo with complementary and alternative money. Implemented in ZeroFrame and AngularJS. Focus on privacy, encryption, max data on client and min data on server.

Project status: Spare time project, work in progress, no money here yet, for now just a honey trap in the form of a social network 
chat app on a very promissing platform (ZeroNet). Plan adding a wallet and an API to conventional, alternative and complementary 
monetary systems. 

Vision:

For too many people in this world money is only one thing, namely old-fashioned conventional money created at the beginning of 
the 1700 century. This money system growth engine (interest) has worked "well" for about 300 years but falls short in a world with  
limited resources, climate and environmental issues and jobs being taken over by robots and artificial inteligens.

With the current monetary system we will within a few years end up with a world with few ultra-rich, many poor, few with a paid 
job and many uemployed and national economies that will not function any more. A world of great social unrest and maybe wars.

Alternative and complementare money systems can in greater or less extent, replace or support the current monetary system and 
prevent some of the bad things from happen. There exists many alternative and complementare money systems, but they are not as 
as accessible and real for people as the good old conventional money. 

The primary goal of the Money Network is to make complementary and alternative monetary systems just as real and accessible as 
regular conventional money. 


IT: 

Very low tech languages. Just html5, ccs3, javascript, angularJS and ZeroNet. Lots of comments and should be easy to follow. 

AngularJS v1.5.8 https://angularjs.org/ (very well documented)

ZeroNet 5.0 https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/ (pure documented)

For now no test framework. Just testing manually.
