# Zeronet-Money-Network
Demo with complementary and alternative money. Implemented in ZeroFrame and AngularJS. Focus on privacy, encryption, max data on client and min data on server. 

## Demo
- http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JeHa67QEvrrFpsSow82fLypw8LoRcmCXk/ ([ZeroNet](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_zeronet/installing/) required)
- https://bit.no.com:43110/1JeHa67QEvrrFpsSow82fLypw8LoRcmCXk/ (proxy)
- https://zeronet.korso.win/1JeHa67QEvrrFpsSow82fLypw8LoRcmCXk/ (proxy)
- https://proxy1.zn.kindlyfire.me/1JeHa67QEvrrFpsSow82fLypw8LoRcmCXk/ (proxy)

This demo should be safe to check out on a ZeroNet proxy server. 
You can see all ZeroNet sites on proxy servers but do not use your normal ZeroNet cert on a ZeroNet proxy server.

## Project status
Spare time project, work in progress, no money in here yet, for now just a honey trap in the form of a social network 
chat app on a very promising platform (ZeroNet). Plan to add a wallet and an API to conventional, alternative and complementary 
monetary systems. 

## Vision
For too many people in this world money is only one thing, namely old-fashioned conventional money created at the beginning of 
the 1700 century. This money system growth engine (interest) has worked "well" for about 300 years but falls short in a world with
limited resources, climate and environmental issues and jobs being taken over by robots and artificial intelligence.

With the current monetary system we will within a few years end up in a world with few ultra-rich, many poor, few with a paid 
job and many unemployed and national economies that will not function any more. A world of great social unrest and maybe wars.

Alternative and complementary money systems can in greater or less extent, replace or support the current monetary system and 
prevent some of the bad things from happening. There exists many alternative and complementary money systems, but they are not as 
accessible and real for people as good old conventional money. 

The primary goal of the Money Network is to make complementary and alternative monetary systems just as real and accessible as 
regular conventional money. 

## Software 
- html5, ccs3, javascript. Simple code, lots of comments and code should be easy to follow. 
- [AngularJS v1.5.8](https://angularjs.org/) (very well documented).
- [ZeroNet 5.0](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/) (documentation could be better).
- Test: for now no testing framework. Just testing manually.

## Help
Test help would by nice. Create an issue if you find something that should be fixed.

Css help would be nice. I am not a css person. I am having some problem with fixed menu and scroll in pages.

Ideas and inspiration are welcome. Specially on wallet and money API parts that have not yet been started. Fell free to create an issue with your inputs,
