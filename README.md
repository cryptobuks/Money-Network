# Money-Network
Demo with complementary and alternative money. Implemented in ZeroFrame and AngularJS. Focus on privacy, encryption, max data on client and min data on server. 

Money is everything. Money Network is a demo about money. With inspiration from Charles Eisenstein, Bernard Lietaer and others.

Our world has one serious error. Our current monetary system. Almost all problems on our planet is caused by this error.
This is an attempt to make money free. To build a bridge between our present traditional monetary system and an ecosystem of complementare and alternative money systems. A monetary ecosystem will solve many of the problems the world are facing today.

The vision here is one wallet with easy access to any kind of money.
Be free. Use the money systems you like and not only the money system that has been forced on you for over 300 years.
Here is the demo. Someone more skilled than I may bring the vision into real existence.

## Project status
Spare time project, work in progress, no money in here yet. For now just a chat app on a very promising platform (ZeroNet). 

Implemented:
- End-2-end encryption. Data in localStorage and on ZeroNet is encrypted. Only search tags and public chat are stored in clear on ZeroNet. 
- Contact list: Categories: new, guest, unverified, verified and ignored.
- Chat: One and two panel chat, encrypted personal and group chat & unencrypted public chat, markdown, emojis, reactions and comments

Todo:
- Wallet, money and API to external money systems. One ZeroNet merger site for each external money system. Starting with a test BitCoins wallet (blocktrail.com) and API for internal ZeroNet communication between MoneyNetwork and wallet sites.

## Demo
- http://127.0.0.1:43110/moneynetwork.bit/ ([ZeroNet](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_zeronet/installing/) required)

This demo should be safe to check out on a ZeroNet proxy server. 
You can see all ZeroNet sites on proxy servers but do not use your normal ZeroNet cert on a ZeroNet proxy server.

## Software 
- html5, ccs3, javascript and some sql. Simple code, lots of comments and code should be "easy"" to follow. 
- [AngularJS v1.5.8](https://angularjs.org/) (very well documented).
- [ZeroNet 5.0](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/) (documentation could be better).
- Test: for now no testing framework. Just testing manually.

## Help
Test help would by nice. Create an issue if you find something that should be fixed.

Ideas and inspiration are welcome. Specially on wallet and money API parts that have not yet been started. Fell free to create an issue with your inputs,
